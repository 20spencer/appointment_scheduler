    School project to make an appointment scheduling app with a simple GUI using Java.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a simple GUI based appointment scheduling application that lets you add, change, and delete appointments and information about the appointment. It also let you view upcoming appointments and sort them by date. There is an initial login window with a text file that tracks all login attempts.

Unfortunately the project connected to and used a temporary database, and so it can no longer run properly as the associated database was removed.
